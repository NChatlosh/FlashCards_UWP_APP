# FlashCards_UWP_APP
This was one of my final projects last year for an OOP class. It is a simple UWP app that you can sue to create digital flash cards of three varieties: multiple choice, matching, and fill in the blank. You can save a grouping of cards into a set and save it to a JSON file. The app handles the serialization/deserialization of the JSON files. Once a set is completed, you can play through it and answer the questions as needed, each being randomly selected from the set and rewarding points for every correct answer so that you can guage how
well you are doing. This was a bit of an older project, so there is a lot of code I would change to make this fit more of a MVVM type design pattern, but it does show some remenants of the pattern. The CardManager class in this case acts like a repository of Card objects, but the project lacks a defined ViewModel and proper data binding (which would be much mroe efficient), instead relying on code behind and events. If I were to come back to this project I'd scrap the events and use commands and ViewModels instead to emulate more of what I did in my Currency projects. I'd still like to add in the future a new image card type as well.
